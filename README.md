Classifying loans 

Researchers that need to make sense of large volumes of data sometimes rely on classification algorithms. AdaBoost is a type of gradient boosting classification algorithm. It fits a sequence of weak learners on different weighted training data. 

AdaBoost has been widely adopted in fields including biology, finance, and speech processing. The algorithm is sensitive to outliers in the data but it less influenced to model overfitting. Here is roughly how the classification algorithm works. 

1.	Predicts original data and gives equal weight to each observation.
2.	Gives a higher weight to observations that have been predicted incorrectly.
3.	Continues to add weak learners until a limit is reach in terms of the number of models or accuracy
